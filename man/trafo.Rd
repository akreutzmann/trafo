\title{An R package supporting the selection of a suitable transformation}
\description{
Estimation, selection and comparison of several families of
transformations. The families of transformations included in the package are 
the following: Bickel-Docksum, Box-Cox, Dual, Glog, Gpower, Log, Log-shift opt,
Manly, Modulus, Neglog, Reciprocal and Yeo-Johnson. The package simplifies to 
compare linear models with untransformed and transformed dependent variable 
as well as linear models where the dependent variable is transformed with 
different transformations. Furthermore, the package employs maximum likelihood 
approaches, skewness and divergence minimization to estimate the optimal 
transformation parameter.
