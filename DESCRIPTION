Title: Package for estimation, comparison and selection of transformations
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Lily", "Medina", email = "lilymiru@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Estimation, selection and comparison of several families of
    transformations. The families of transformations included in the package are the
    Box-Cox transformation, the Manly transformation, the Yeo-Johnson transformation,
    the Modulus transformation, the Bickel-Docksum transformation and the dual
    transformation. The package simplifies to compare linear and linear mixed 
    models with untransformed and transformed dependent variable. Furthermore, 
    the package employs maximum likelihood approaches, skewness and divergence 
    minimization to estimate the optimal transformation parameter.
