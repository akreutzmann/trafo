Title: Package for estimation, comparison and selection of transformations
Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: Estimation, selection and comparison of several families of
    transformations. The families of transformations included in the package are the
    BoxCox transformation, the Manly transformation, the YeoJohnson transformation,
    the modulus transformation, the BickelDocksum transformation and the dual
    transformation. The package includes a function to compare these transformations
    and a function that helps to select one between them. The first version
    of the new package employs the maximum likelihood approach to estimate the
    transformation parameter, and proposes the use of Akaikes Information Criterion
    AIC, the coefficient of determination R.Squared, Skewness, and Kurtosis as
    methods to compare different families of transformations.
