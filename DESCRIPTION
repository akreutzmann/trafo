Title: Package for estimation, comparison and selection of transformations
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Lily", "Medina", email = "lilymiru@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Estimation, selection and comparison of several families of
 transformations. The families of transformations included in the package are 
 the following: Bickel-Docksum, Box-Cox, Dual, Glog, Gpower, Log, Log-shift opt,
 Manly, Modulus, Neglog, Reciprocal and Yeo-Johnson. The package simplifies to 
 compare linear models with untransformed and transformed dependent variable 
 as well as linear models where the dependent variable is transformed with 
 different transformations. Furthermore, the package employs maximum likelihood 
 approaches, moments optimization and divergence minimization to estimate the optimal 
 transformation parameter.
