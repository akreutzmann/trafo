Title: Package for estimation, comparison and selection of transformations
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Lily", "Medina", email = "lilymiru@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Estimation, selection and comparison of several families of
    transformations. The families of transformations included in the package are the
    Box-Cox transformation, the Manly transformation, the Yeo-Johnson transformation,
    the Modulus transformation, the Bickel-Docksum transformation and the dual
    transformation. The package includes a function to compare these transformations
    and a function that helps to select one between them. The package employs 
    the maximum likelihood approach, skewness and divergence minimization to estimate the
    transformation parameter, and proposes the use of Akaikes Information Criterion
    (AIC), the coefficient of determination R.Squared, Skewness, and Kurtosis as
    methods to compare different families of transformations.
