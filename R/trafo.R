#' An R package supporting the selection of a suitable transformation
#' 
#' Estimation, selection and comparison of several families of
#' transformations. The families of transformations included in the package are 
#' the Box-Cox transformation, the Manly transformation, the Yeo-Johnson 
#' transformation, the Modulus transformation, the Bickel-Docksum transformation 
#' and the dual transformation. The package simplifies to compare linear and 
#' linear mixed models with untransformed and transformed dependent variable. 
#' Furthermore, the package employs maximum likelihood approaches, skewness and 
#' divergence minimization to estimate the optimal transformation parameter.
